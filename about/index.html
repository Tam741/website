            <p class="wrap-text">Hi, I'm Tristan, a passionate technology enthusiast and learner.
		     My journey into the world of technology started with a curiosity for computers and coding. Over time,
		     my interest has expanded to include everything from web development to exploring the latest tech innovations.<br>
		    I'm driven by the challenges that technology presents and the endless possibilities it offers for solving real-world problems. 
		    Through this website, I share my experiences, projects, and insights, hoping to inspire others who are just starting their tech journey or who, like me, are constantly learning and growing in the tech field. <br>
		    Whether you're a beginner or an experienced tech professional, I hope you find inspiration in the stories and lessons I've learned along the way. 
		    Join me as I continue to explore, create, and push the boundaries of what's possible in the exciting world of technology.</p>
